title: Hurrahing in Harvest

Summer ends now; now, barbarous in beauty, the stooks rise 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around; up above, what wind-walks! What lovely behaviour 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of silk-sack clouds! has wilder, wilful-wavier 
Meal-drift moulded ever and melted across skies? 

I walk, I lift up, I lift up heart, eyes, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down all that glory in the heavens to glean our Saviour; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, éyes, héart, what looks, what lips yet gave you a 
Rapturous love's greeting of realer, of rounder replies? 

And the azurous hung hills are his world-wielding shoulder 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Majestic - as a stallion stalwart, very-violet-sweet! - 
These things, these things were here and but the beholder 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wanting; which two when they once meet, 
The heart rears wings bold and bolder 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hurls for him, O half hurls earth for him off under his feet.
