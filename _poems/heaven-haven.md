_A nun takes the veil_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have desired to go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where springs not fail,
To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few lilies blow.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have asked to be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where no storms come,
Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And out of the swing of the sea.
