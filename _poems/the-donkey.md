When fishes flew and forests walked
&nbsp;&nbsp;And figs grew upon thorn,
Some moment when the moon was blood
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then surely I was born.

With monstrous head and sickening cry
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ears like errant wings,
The devil’s walking parody
&nbsp;&nbsp;On all four-footed things.

The tattered outlaw of the earth,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ancient crooked will;
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb,
&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep my secret still.

Fools! For I also had my hour;
&nbsp;&nbsp;One far fierce hour and sweet:
There was a shout about my ears,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And palms before my feet.
