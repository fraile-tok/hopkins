_To Christ our Lord_

I caught this morning morning's minion, king-
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the rolling level underneath him steady air, and striding
High there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing
In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebuffed the big wind. My heart in hiding
Stirred for a bird, – the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!

Brute beauty and valour and act, oh, air, pride, plume, here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buckle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion
Times told lovelier, more dangerous, O my chevalier!
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder of it: shéer plód makes plough down sillion
Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ah my dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall, gall themselves, and gash gold-vermilion.
