Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilty of dust and sin.
But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my first entrance in,
Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I lacked anything.

"A guest," I answered, "worthy to be here":
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love said, "You shall be he."
"I, the unkind, ungrateful? Ah, my dear,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot look on thee."
Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who made the eyes but I?"

"Truth, Lord; but I have marred them; let my shame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go where it doth deserve."
"And know you not," says Love, "who bore the blame?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"My dear, then I will serve."
"You must sit down," says Love, "and taste my meat."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I did sit and eat.
