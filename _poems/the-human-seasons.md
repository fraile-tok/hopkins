title: The Human Seasons

Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four seasons in the mind of man:
He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes in all beauty with an easy span:
He has his Summer, when luxuriously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves
To ruminate, and by such dreaming high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves
His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He furleth close; contented so to look
On mists in idleness—to let fair things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,
Or else he would forego his mortal nature
