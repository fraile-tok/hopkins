What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Only the monstrous anger of the guns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
Can patter out their hasty orisons.
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,—
The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bugles calling for them from sad shires.

What candles may be held to speed them all?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;
Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
