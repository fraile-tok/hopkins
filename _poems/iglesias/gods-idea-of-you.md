<!-- Version 1, May 2025 -->

<!-- Easy it might well seem-->
<!-- Cheap, fake, and phony even-->
<!-- To call you, woman,-->
<!-- The prettiest thing alive,-->
<!-- Pristine jewel of Creation,-->
<!-- My Sun, Moon, and Stars.-->
<!-- -->
<!-- You will say I sin of flattery-->
<!-- and that I abuse metaphor-->
<!-- Spreading truth ever-so thin-->
<!-- And deceiving, above all-->
<!-- My own, poor, unknowing soul.-->
<!-- -->
<!-- How dare you, I say, accuse me thus?-->
<!-- For drawing truth from Creation's well -->
<!-- When my own words have proved lacking?-->
<!-- -->
<!-- For all I may say,-->
<!-- I both see and believe,-->
<!-- And before my eyes-->
<!-- You seem not too different-->
<!-- From the Sun's golden warmth-->
<!-- And the Moon's silver calm;-->
<!-- Your eyes seem then stars,-->
<!-- Or the stars your eyes,-->
<!-- I am yet not sure.-->
<!-- -->
<!-- And all these things are-->
<!-- Ever-bright, ever-kind,-->
<!-- As if they were fashioned, too,-->
<!-- From God's idea of you.-->

<!-- Version 2, January 2026-->
Easy it might well seem,
Cheap, fake, and phony even,
To call you, woman,
The prettiest thing alive,
Pristine jewel of Creation,
My Sun, Moon, and Stars.

You will say I sin of flattery
And that I abuse metaphor,
Spreading truth ever-so thin,
And deceiving, above all,
My own unknowing soul.

How dare you accuse me thus?
For drawing truth from Creation's well
When my own words have proved lacking?

For all praise I say
I both see and believe,
And before my eyes
You seem not too different
From the Sun's golden warmth,
And the Moon's silver calm;
Your eyes seem then stars,
Or the stars your eyes,
I am yet not sure.

And all these things are
Ever-bright, ever-kind,
As if they are fashioned, too,
From God's idea of you.
