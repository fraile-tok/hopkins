title: Walk Slowly

Walk slowly; do not rush:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day lasts still the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As when your face bore not your beard,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when dreams were dreams, never weights.
Walk slowly; do not rush:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember the birds who still greet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dawn that still comes.
