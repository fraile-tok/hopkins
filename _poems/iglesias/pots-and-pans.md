Where does love hide?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fragance of roses?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we find it, solely,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the gazes of lovers?
Does it bear any marks?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is any ever-lasting?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we know of it only,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through our own longing?

Thankfully, glamour does wear off.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers are now watered, not bought.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passion is now patience. Tryst, routine.
Seems, then, wise Therese was right:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where does Love hide?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the pots, among the pans.
