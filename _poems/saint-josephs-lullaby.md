_Hum_, _hum_, the carpenter hums, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding in arms the weight of the world.
His love by his side, asleep witha smile,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But doubt, doubt, creeps in his mind.

Child, child, rests in his chest,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling asleep to the beat of his heart.
A fire nearby, to keep them all warm,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But cold, cold, sets on his brow.

Sleep, sleep, beautiful child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the chest of one of God's best.
His doubt shall find some lie to live by,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a smile, smile will rouse his old laugh.

Sing, sing, young father your song,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the greatest sign of undying love.
Cast doubt away, let it wither and die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a task so divine's a gift to live by.
