A Sonnet is a moment's monument,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memorial from the Soul's eternity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,
Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,
Of its own arduous fulness reverent:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carve it in ivory or in ebony,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see
Its flowering crest impearl'd and orient.
A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul,— its converse, to what Power 'tis due: —
Whether for tribute to the august appeals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,
It serve; or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,
In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death.
