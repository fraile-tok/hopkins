My Morning Star, I wish to say to you,
Elegant muse of yearnings deep to me,
Rarely my eyes have seen such beauty,
Clad in the most divine of earthly glows:
Ere the Last Dawn, my life's most just delight.

Do you conceive how deep you make me wish,
Each breath to be a gift I take for you?

Such grace must be our God's most perfect line.
