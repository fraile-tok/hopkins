title: With Money Dances the Dog

With money dances the dog,
The only truth in the world.
The rule of one devoid of God.

You are but a mere cog,
Into a cruel machine hurled.
With money dances the dog.

You hear the fall of the flog,
From a war in the East unfurled.
The rule of one devoid of God.

You are to live among smog,
Inside walls that force you curled.
With money dances the dog.

They watch you, like a hawk,
You know, you know you are controlled.
The rule of one devoid of God.

Little you do but nod,
"The dice has been rolled".
With money dances the dog,
The rule of one devoid of God.
