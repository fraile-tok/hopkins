Out of the night that covers me,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not winced nor cried aloud,
Under the bludgeonings of chance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looms but the horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the captain of my soul.
