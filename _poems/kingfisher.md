A hunter, perched on a tree,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waits, gazes, 'til water ripples.
Now! A chance!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the kingfisher dive!
He cuts through the air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As old, mighty lance,
To catch in his beak,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some unlucky fish.

Nature's winged harpoon,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sports a coat ever-blue,
But in flight you may catch,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His proud orange chest,
Or, in a moment of grace,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His Maker's care.
