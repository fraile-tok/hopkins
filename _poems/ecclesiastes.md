title: Ecclesiastes
---

There is one sin: to call a green leaf gray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereat the sun in heaven shuddereth.
There is one blasphemy: for death to pray,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God alone knoweth the praise of death.

There is one creed: 'neath no world-terror’s wing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apples forget to grow on apple-trees.
There is one thing is needful everything
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest is vanity of vanities.
