Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there!
Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves'-eyes!
The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare! 
Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize.

Buy then! bid then! — What? — Prayer, patience, alms, vows.
Look, look: a May-mess, like on orchard boughs!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look! March-bloom, like on mealed-with-yellow sallows!
These are indeed the barn; withindoors house
The shocks. This piece-bright paling shuts the spouse
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ home, Christ and his mother and all his hallows.
