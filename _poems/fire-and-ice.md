title: Fire and Ice

Some say the world will end in fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say in ice.
From what I’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would suffice.
