&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Cannot ope mine eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou art ready there to catch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My morning-soul and sacrifice:
Then we must needs for that day make a match.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, what is a heart?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silver, or gold, or precious stone,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or starre, or rainbow, or a part
Of all these things, or all of them in one?
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My God, what is a heart?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst it so eye, and wooe,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powring upon it all thy art,
As if that thou hadst nothing els to do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed mans whole estate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amounts (and richly) to serve thee:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not heav’n and earth create,
Yet studies them, not him by whom they be.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teach me thy love to know;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this new light, which now I see,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May both the work and workman show:
Then by a sunne-beam I will climbe to thee.
