        <h1>Mythopoeia</h1>
        <p id="author">J.R.R. Tolkien</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>To one who said that myths were lies and therefore worthless, even though 'breathed through silver'.</p>
<p><em>Philomythus to Misomythus</em></p>
<p>You look at trees and label them just so,<br />
(for trees are 'trees', and growing is 'to grow');<br />
you walk the earth and tread with solemn pace<br />
one of the many minor globes of Space:<br />
a star's a star, some matter in a ball<br />
compelled to courses mathematical<br />
amid the regimented, cold, Inane,<br />
where destined atoms are each moment slain.</p>
<p>At bidding of a Will, to which we bend<br />
(and must), but only dimly apprehend,<br />
great processes march on, as Time unrolls<br />
from dark beginnings to uncertain goals;<br />
and as on page o'erwritten without clue,<br />
with script and limning packed of various hue,<br />
an endless multitude of forms appear,<br />
some grim, some frail, some beautiful, some queer,<br />
each alien, except as kin from one<br />
remote Origo, gnat, man, stone, and sun.<br />
God made the petreous rocks, the arboreal trees,<br />
tellurian earth, and stellar stars, and these<br />
homuncular men, who walk upon the ground<br />
with nerves that tingle touched by light and sound.<br />
The movements of the sea, the wind in boughs,<br />
green grass, the large slow oddity of cows,<br />
thunder and lightning, birds that wheel and cry,<br />
slime crawling up from mud to live and die,<br />
these each are duly registered and print<br />
the brain's contortions with a separate dint.</p>
<p>Yet trees are not 'trees', until so named and seen -<br />
and never were so named, till those had been<br />
who speech's involuted breath unfurled,<br />
faint echo and dim picture of the world,<br />
but neither record nor a photograph,<br />
being divination, judgement, and a laugh,<br />
response of chose that felt astir within<br />
by deep monition movements that were kin<br />
to life and death of trees, of beasts, of stars:<br />
free captives undermining shadowy bars,<br />
digging the foreknown from experience<br />
and panning the vein of spirit out of sense.</p>
<p>Great powers they slowly brought out of themselves,<br />
and looking backward they beheld the elves<br />
that wrought on cunning forges in the mind,<br />
and light and dark on secret looms entwined.</p>
<p>He sees no stars who does not see them first<br />
of living silver made that sudden burst<br />
to flame like flowers beneath an ancient song,<br />
whose very echo after-music long<br />
has since pursued. There is no firmament,<br />
only a void, unless a jewelled tent<br />
myth-woven and elf-patterned; and no earth,<br />
unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.</p>
<p>The heart of man is not compound of lies,<br />
but draws some wisdom from the only Wise,<br />
and still recalls him. Though now long estranged,<br />
man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed.<br />
Dis-graced he may be, yet is not dethroned,<br />
and keeps the rags of lordship one he owned,<br />
his world-dominion by creative act:<br />
not his to worship the great Artefact.<br />
man, sub-creator, the refracted light<br />
through whom is splintered from a single White<br />
to many hues, and endlessly combined<br />
in living shapes that move from mind to mind.<br />
Though all the crannies of the world we filled<br />
with elves and goblins, though we dared to build<br />
gods and their houses out of dark and light,<br />
and sow the seed of dragons, 'twas our right<br />
(used or misused). The right has not decayed.<br />
We make still by the law in which were made.</p>
<p>Yes! 'wish-fulfilment dreams' we spin to cheat<br />
our timid hearts and ugly Fact defeat!<br />
Whence came the wish, and whence the power to dream,<br />
or some things fair and others ugly deem?<br />
All wishes are not idle, nor in vain<br />
fulfilment we devise - for pain is pain,<br />
not for itself to be desired, but ill;<br />
or else to strive or to subdue the will<br />
alike were graceless; and of Evil this<br />
alone is dreadly certain: Evil is.</p>
<p>Blessed are the timid hearts that evil hate,<br />
that quail in its shadow, and yet shut the gate;<br />
that seek no parley, and in guarded room,<br />
though small and bare, upon a clumsy loom<br />
weave tissues gilded by the far-off day<br />
hoped and believed in under Shadow's sway.</p>
<p>Blessed are the men of Noah's race that build<br />
their little arks, though frail and poorly filled,<br />
and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith,<br />
a rumour of a harbour guessed by faith.</p>
<p>Blessed are the legend-makers with their rhyme<br />
of things not found within recorded time.<br />
It is not they that have forgot the Night,<br />
or bid us flee to organized delight,<br />
in lotus-isles of economic bliss<br />
forswearing souls to gain a Circe-kiss<br />
(and counterfeit at that, machine-produced,<br />
bogus seduction of the twice-seduced).</p>
<p>Such isles they saw afar, and ones more fair,<br />
and those that hear them yet may yet beware.<br />
They have seen Death and ultimate defeat,<br />
and yet they would not in despair retreat,<br />
but oft to victory have turned the lyre<br />
and kindled hearts with legendary fire,<br />
illuminating Now and dark Hath-been<br />
with light of suns as yet by no man seen.</p>
<p>I would that I might with the minstrels sing<br />
and stir the unseen with a throbbing string.<br />
I would be with the mariners of the deep<br />
that cut their slender planks on mountains steep<br />
and voyage upon a vague and wandering quest,<br />
for some have passed beyond the fabled West.<br />
I would with the beleaguered fools be told,<br />
that keep an inner fastness where their gold,<br />
impure and scanty, yet they loyally bring<br />
to mint in image blurred of distant king,<br />
or in fantastic banners weave the sheen<br />
heraldic emblems of a lord unseen.</p>
<p>I will not walk with your progressive apes,<br />
erect and sapient. Before them gapes<br />
the dark abyss to which their progress tends -<br />
if by God's mercy progress ever ends,<br />
and does not ceaselessly revolve the same<br />
unfruitful course with changing of a name.<br />
I will not treat your dusty path and flat,<br />
denoting this and that by this and chat,<br />
your world immutable wherein no part<br />
the little maker has with maker's art.<br />
I bow not yet before the Iron Crown,<br />
nor cast my own small golden sceptre down.</p>
<p>In Paradise perchance the eye may stray<br />
from gazing upon everlasting Day<br />
to see the day-illumined, and renew<br />
from mirrored truth the likeness of the True<br />
Then looking on the Blessed Land 'twill see<br />
that all is as it is, and yet made free:<br />
Salvation changes not, nor yet destroys,<br />
garden nor gardener, children nor their toys.<br />
Evil it will not see, for evil lies<br />
not in God's picture but in crooked eyes,<br />
not in the source but in malicious choice,<br />
and not in sound but in the tuneless voice.<br />
In Paradise they look no more awry;<br />
and though they make anew, they make no lie.<br />
Be sure they still will make, not being dead,<br />
and poets shall have flames upon their head,<br />
and harps whereon their faultless fingers fall:<br />
there each shall choose for ever from the All.</p></div>
