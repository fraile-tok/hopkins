        <h1>Ode to a Nightingale</h1>
        <p id="author">John Keats</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains<br />
         My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,<br />
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains<br />
         One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:<br />
'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,<br />
         But being too happy in thine happiness,—<br />
                That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees<br />
                        In some melodious plot<br />
         Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,<br />
                Singest of summer in full-throated ease.</p>
<p>O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been<br />
         Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,<br />
Tasting of Flora and the country green,<br />
         Dance, and Provençal song, and sunburnt mirth!<br />
O for a beaker full of the warm South,<br />
         Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,<br />
                With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,<br />
                        And purple-stained mouth;<br />
         That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,<br />
                And with thee fade away into the forest dim:</p>
<p>Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget<br />
         What thou among the leaves hast never known,<br />
The weariness, the fever, and the fret<br />
         Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;<br />
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,<br />
         Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;<br />
                Where but to think is to be full of sorrow<br />
                        And leaden-eyed despairs,<br />
         Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,<br />
                Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.</p>
<p>Away! away! for I will fly to thee,<br />
         Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,<br />
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,<br />
         Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:<br />
Already with thee! tender is the night,<br />
         And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,<br />
                Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;<br />
                        But here there is no light,<br />
         Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown<br />
                Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.</p>
<p>I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,<br />
         Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,<br />
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet<br />
         Wherewith the seasonable month endows<br />
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;<br />
         White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;<br />
                Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;<br />
                        And mid-May's eldest child,<br />
         The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,<br />
                The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.</p>
<p>Darkling I listen; and, for many a time<br />
         I have been half in love with easeful Death,<br />
Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,<br />
         To take into the air my quiet breath;<br />
                Now more than ever seems it rich to die,<br />
         To cease upon the midnight with no pain,<br />
                While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad<br />
                        In such an ecstasy!<br />
         Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain—<br />
                   To thy high requiem become a sod.</p>
<p>Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br />
         No hungry generations tread thee down;<br />
The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br />
         In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br />
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br />
         Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br />
                She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br />
                        The same that oft-times hath<br />
         Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam<br />
                Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</p>
<p>Forlorn! the very word is like a bell<br />
         To toll me back from thee to my sole self!<br />
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well<br />
         As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.<br />
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br />
         Past the near meadows, over the still stream,<br />
                Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep<br />
                        In the next valley-glades:<br />
         Was it a vision, or a waking dream?<br />
                Fled is that music:—Do I wake or sleep?</p></div>
