        <h1>Hound of Heaven</h1>
        <p id="author">Francis Thompson</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>I fled Him down the nights and down the days<br />
I fled Him down the arches of the years<br />
I fled Him down the labyrinthine ways<br />
Of my own mind, and in the midst of tears<br />
I hid from him, and under running laughter.<br />
Up vistaed hopes I sped and shot precipitated<br />
Adown titanic glooms of chasme d hears<br />
From those strong feet that followed, followed after<br />
But with unhurrying chase and unperturbe d pace,<br />
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,<br />
They beat, and a Voice beat,<br />
More instant than the feet:<br />
All things betray thee who betrayest me.</p>
<p>I pleaded, outlaw—wise by many a hearted casement,<br />
curtained red, trellised with inter-twining charities,<br />
For though I knew His love who followe d,<br />
Yet was I sore adread, lest having Him,<br />
I should have nought beside.<br />
But if one little casement parted wide,<br />
The gust of his approach would clash it to.<br />
Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.<br />
Across the margent of the world I fled,<br />
And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,<br />
Smiting for shelter on their clange d bars,<br />
Fretted to dulcet jars and silvern chatter<br />
The pale ports of the moon.</p>
<p>I said to Dawn——be sudden, to Eve——be soon,<br />
With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over<br />
From this tremendous Lover.<br />
Float thy vague veil about me lest He see.<br />
I tempted all His servitors but to find<br />
My own betrayal in their constancy,<br />
In faith to Him, their fickleness to me,<br />
Their traitorous trueness and their loyal deceit.<br />
To all swift things for swiftness did I sue,<br />
Clung to the whistling mane of every wind,<br />
But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,<br />
The long savannahs of the blue,<br />
Or whether, thunder-driven,<br />
They clanged His chariot thwart a heaven,<br />
Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn of their feet,<br />
Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.<br />
Still with unhurrying chase and unperturbed pace<br />
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,<br />
Came on the following feet, and a Voice above their beat:<br />
Nought shelters thee who wilt not shelter Me.</p>
<p>I sought no more that after which I strayed<br />
In face of Man or Maid.<br />
But still within the little childrens’ eyes<br />
Seems something, something that replies,<br />
They at least are for me, surely for me.<br />
But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair,<br />
With dawning answers there,<br />
Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.<br />
Come then, ye other children, Nature’s<br />
Share with me, said I, your delicate fellowship.<br />
Let me greet you lip to lip,<br />
Let me twine with you caresses,<br />
Wantoning with our Lady Mother’s vagrant tresses,<br />
Banqueting with her in her wind walled palace,<br />
Underneath her azured dai:s,<br />
Quaffing, as your taintless way is,<br />
From a chalice, lucent weeping out of the dayspring.</p>
<p>So it was done.<br />
I in their delicate fellowship was one.<br />
Drew the bolt of Nature’s secrecies,<br />
I knew all the swift importings on the wilful face of skies,<br />
I knew how the clouds arise,<br />
Spume d of the wild sea-snortings.<br />
All that’s born or dies,<br />
Rose and drooped with,<br />
Made them shapers of mine own moods, or wailful, or Divine.<br />
With them joyed and was bereaven.<br />
I was heavy with the Even,<br />
when she lit her glimmering tapers round the day’s dead sanctities.<br />
I laughed in the morning’s eyes.<br />
I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,<br />
Heaven and I wept together,<br />
and its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine.<br />
Against the red throb of its sunset heart,<br />
I laid my own to beat<br />
And share commingling heat.</p>
<p>But not by that, by that was eased my human smart.<br />
In vain my tears were wet on Heaven’s grey cheek.<br />
For ah! we know what each other says,<br />
these things and I; In sound I speak,<br />
Their sound is but their stir, they speak by silences.<br />
Nature, poor step-dame, cannot slake my drouth.<br />
Let her, if she would owe me<br />
Drop yon blue-bosomed veil of sky<br />
And show me the breasts o’ her tenderness.<br />
Never did any milk of hers once bless my thirsting mouth.<br />
Nigh and nigh draws the chase, with unperturbe d pace<br />
Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,<br />
And past those noise d feet, a Voice comes yet more fleet:<br />
Lo, nought contentst thee who content’st nought Me.</p>
<p>Naked, I wait thy Love’s uplifted stroke. My harness, piece by piece,<br />
thou’st hewn from me<br />
And smitten me to my knee,<br />
I am defenceless, utterly.<br />
I slept methinks, and awoke.<br />
And slowly gazing, find me stripped in sleep.<br />
In the rash lustihead of my young powers,<br />
I shook the pillaring hours,<br />
and pulled my life upon me.<br />
Grimed with smears,<br />
I stand amidst the dust o’ the mounded years—<br />
My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.<br />
My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,<br />
Have puffed and burst like sunstarts on a stream.<br />
Yeah, faileth now even dream the dreamer<br />
and the lute, the lutanist.<br />
Even the linked fantasies in whose blossomy twist,<br />
I swung the Earth, a trinket at my wrist,<br />
Have yielded, cords of all too weak account,<br />
For Earth, with heavy grief so overplussed.<br />
Ah! is thy Love indeed a weed,<br />
albeit an Amaranthine weed,<br />
Suffering no flowers except its own to mount?<br />
Ah! must, Designer Infinite,<br />
Ah! must thou char the wood 'ere thou canst limn with it?<br />
My freshness spent its wavering shower i’ the dust.<br />
And now my heart is as a broken fount,<br />
Wherein tear-drippings stagnate, spilt down ever<br />
From the dank thoughts that shiver upon the sighful branches of my<br />
mind.</p>
<p>Such is. What is to be?<br />
The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?<br />
I dimly guess what Time in mists confounds,<br />
Yet ever and anon, a trumpet sounds<br />
From the hid battlements of Eternity.<br />
Those shaken mists a space unsettle,<br />
Then round the half-glimpse d turrets, slowly wash again.<br />
But not 'ere Him who summoneth<br />
I first have seen, enwound<br />
With glooming robes purpureal; Cypress crowned.<br />
His name I know, and what his trumpet saith.<br />
Whether Man’s Heart or Life it be that yield thee harvest,<br />
Must thy harvest fields be dunged with rotten death?</p>
<p>Now of that long pursuit,<br />
Comes at hand the bruit.<br />
That Voice is round me like a bursting Sea:<br />
And is thy Earth so marred,<br />
Shattered in shard on shard?<br />
Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest me.<br />
Strange, piteous, futile thing;<br />
Wherefore should any set thee love apart?<br />
Seeing none but I makes much of Naught (He said).<br />
And human love needs human meriting—<br />
How hast thou merited,<br />
Of all Man’s clotted clay, the dingiest clot.<br />
Alack! Thou knowest not<br />
How little worthy of any love thou art.<br />
Whom wilt thou find to love ignoble thee,<br />
Save me, save only me?<br />
All which I took from thee, I did’st but take,<br />
Not for thy harms,<br />
But just that thou might’st seek it in my arms.<br />
All which thy childs mistake fancies as lost,<br />
I have stored for thee at Home.<br />
Rise, clasp my hand, and come.<br />
Halts by me that Footfall.<br />
Is my gloom, after all,<br />
Shade of His hand, outstretched caressingly?<br />
Ah, Fondest, Blindest, Weakest,<br />
I am He whom thou seekest.<br />
Thou dravest Love from thee who dravest Me.</p></div>
