        <h1>The Eldest</h1>

        <div id="content"><p>The first of the memories I hold,<br />
Those that have yet not flown away,<br />
Is that of the day I told the world,<br />
I would become a big brother once more.</p>
<p>First was my brother, one December,<br />
And then her, in August's times.<br />
For as long as I can remember,<br />
All my life can be told in these lines:</p>
<p>That I am the eldest, eldest of three,<br />
Always below me two have been,<br />
Cheerful, joyful, we are, us three.<br />
And above me no one is to be seen.</p>
<p>But is that who I was meant to be?<br />
Or was it just I who happened,<br />
By chance's fateful ruling,<br />
To be not only alive, but born?</p>
<p>The things I have told them,<br />
The good and beautiful,<br />
The bad and the ugly,<br />
Could have been to me told, then.</p>
<p>And I could have been the little one,<br />
And him (perhaps her?) the wise one;<br />
The one I wouldn't listen to,<br />
Or at least pretend not to.</p>
<p>But I am not a little brother.<br />
I have none older to bother.<br />
You, out into the world were never roused,<br />
Instead perished, in that first homely house.</p>
<p>And could I wonder why,<br />
Demanding reasons from the Heavens?<br />
When how could I mourn,<br />
For one that was, but never <em>was</em>?</p>
<p>I am the eldest. Always have been.<br />
But I do hope, I dare hope,<br />
That on God's country green,<br />
The little one, I can be.</p></div>
