        <h1>Lady Sorrows</h1>
        <p id="author">J.P. Iglesias</p>

        <div id="content"><p>I wonder what you made, Mother,<br />
On the day of Candlemass,<br />
Of what old Simeon told you:<br />
'This child is set for the fall<br />
and rising again of many'.<br />
You were warned, then: by a sword,<br />
Your soul would be pierced, too.</p>
<p>Was this to you promised,<br />
When you sung your <em>fiat</em>?<br />
Did the angel show it to you,<br />
When he said 'fear not'?<br />
Or was this surprise to you,<br />
That you were not just Ark,<br />
but casket?</p>
<p>Many will say you didn't.<br />
But I doubt. For wise you are,<br />
And crowned with stars.<br />
When you gazed down, to your womb,<br />
Felt Him kick, were you shown not,<br />
By your Spouse, hallowed Ghost,<br />
The blade Simeon spoke of?</p>
<p>You must have seen. You must.<br />
In every childish fall,<br />
You saw the falls.<br />
In every pair of crossed beams,<br />
You saw His cross.<br />
In every day,<br />
The day that would come.</p>
<p>What did you see, Mother?<br />
Not one, nor seven,<br />
But swords a many.<br />
Without ceasing.<br />
Everyday, all day.<br />
All Man’s, all ours.<br />
My brothers’. My own.</p>
<p>I have mocked Thy Son.<br />
I have betrayed Thy Son.<br />
I have murdered Thy Son.<br />
You knew I would,<br />
Since Gabriel sung.<br />
You knew I would,<br />
When you wed the Ghost.</p>
<p>You watched. You watch.<br />
The way uphill. My sins.<br />
The bloody scourge. Our sins.<br />
The heavy cross. My sins.<br />
My faults. Our faults.<br />
You knew, in your heart,<br />
From that blessed noon.</p></div>
