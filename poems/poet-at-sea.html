        <h1>Poet at Sea</h1>

        <div id="content"><p>What must I think,<br />
When I gaze upon the sea?<br />
What must I see,<br />
When standing before it?</p>
<p>First, I see its extension.<br />
Its blue mantle stretches<br />
Miles and miles, never reached<br />
By the greatest of sketches.</p>
<p>But what are limits<br />
In God's creation?<br />
Are they in the law of the heart?<br />
Or in the law of the mind?</p>
<p>To think of extent<br />
Is to project myself;<br />
To place what is man-made,<br />
Upon God's demesne.</p>
<p>I turn then, my mind's eyes,<br />
To the age of the sea,<br />
Before I was, it was.<br />
After I die, it shall live on.</p>
<p>The sea is never the same.<br />
If you look away, and then back,<br />
The water you called sea<br />
Are now lost.</p>
<p>It has seen many things.<br />
Mighty empires, rise and fall.<br />
Vibrant cities, rich and poor.<br />
But all, all is the same to him.</p>
<p>All comes from the water,<br />
All will return to the water. <br />
Water wears rock into dust,<br />
and from dust we all come.</p>
<p>Before the sea, then,<br />
I am small.<br />
Before him, then,<br />
I am young.</p>
<p>But here we are, riding its waves,<br />
going places in machines,<br />
that carry, in their insides,<br />
the winds of the world.</p>
<p>We might be tempted,<br />
To call ourselves grand.<br />
Singing songs of victory.<br />
Proud of great conquest.</p>
<p>But the wise know it is not true.<br />
They know we are small.<br />
But how small, I ask,<br />
Atop the decks of a ship of glass.</p>
<p>We've reduced size to limits,<br />
Power to dominion,<br />
Ownership to possession,<br />
And Being to charade.</p>
<p>We are small, but the Earth<br />
Is, by divine right, ours.<br />
To have and to hold,<br />
From beginning to end.</p>
<p>We have come to know the sea,<br />
At least what he allows to be seen.<br />
But to be masters?<br />
Not even of ourselves.</p>
<p>What must I think,<br />
When I gaze upon the sea?<br />
What must I see,<br />
When standing before him?</p>
<p>Ever-changing marble.<br />
Sweet, calm, peaceful.<br />
Endless deep-blue mantle.<br />
Violent, roaring, rageful.</p>
<p>We are small,<br />
But, of all things,<br />
Only we know,<br />
That we are.</p></div>
