        <h1>The Promised Land</h1>
        <p id="author">J.P. Iglesias</p>

        <div id="content"><p>From the window I saw<br />
Miles and miles of yellow and grey.<br />
Broken by few rivers and many highways,<br />
The land laid pale.</p>
<p>That there was nothing to see,<br />
Was easy to think.<br />
Why not shut the window?<br />
Get some much-needed sleep?</p>
<p>But I saw the Canyon, out east. <br />
Deep, carved into the desert rock.<br />
And even here, soaring high.<br />
I felt small. I am small.</p>
<p>And we broke then into Oregon, <br />
Where green came again into sight. <br />
Woods and mountains.<br />
Woods cascading over mountains.</p>
<p>First were the Sisters,<br />
Then there was Hood,<br />
with Adams, and St. Helens,<br />
And Rainier at last, mighty and white.</p>
<p>The rivers burrowed through the land. <br />
They ached for the sea.<br />
And I know that in their wooded banks,<br />
Many stories had been wrought. </p>
<p>I wonder what those first men,<br />
Who ventured west, would say,<br />
Could they spy, from here,<br />
Those many things they held dear.</p>
<p>I wonder what they would say,<br />
Had I chosen to lay in the dark,<br />
Laid back in my seat, eyes closed,<br />
And slept over their Promised Land.</p></div>
