        <div id="content"><p>Mistah Kurtz- he dead.</p>
<p>The Hollow Men</p>
<p><em>A penny for the Old Guy</em></p>
<h4>I</h4>
<p>We are the hollow men <br />
We are the stuffed men<br />
Leaning together  <br />
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!<br />
Our dried voices, when<br />
We whisper together <br />
Are quiet and meaningless <br />
As wind in dry grass  <br />
Or rats' feet over broken glass <br />
In our dry cellar <br />
Shape without form, shade without colour, <br />
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;  <br />
Those who have crossed<br />
With direct eyes, to death's other Kingdom<br />
Remember us - if at all - not as lost <br />
Violent souls, but only <br />
As the hollow men <br />
The stuffed men.    </p>
<h4>II</h4>
<p>Eyes I dare not meet in dreams<br />
In death's dream kingdom  <br />
These do not appear:  <br />
There, the eyes are <br />
Sunlight on a broken column <br />
There, is a tree swinging <br />
And voices are<br />
In the wind's singing <br />
More distant and more solemn  <br />
Than a fading star. <br />
Let me be no nearer <br />
In death's dream kingdom  <br />
Let me also wear  <br />
Such deliberate disguises <br />
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves  <br />
In a field<br />
Behaving as the wind behaves<br />
No nearer - <br />
Not that final meeting<br />
In the twilight kingdom </p>
<h4>III</h4>
<p>This is the dead land <br />
This is cactus land <br />
Here the stone images <br />
Are raised, here they receive <br />
The supplication of a dead man's hand <br />
Under the twinkle of a fading star. <br />
Is it like this   <br />
In death's other kingdom  <br />
Waking alone  <br />
At the hour when we are <br />
Trembling with tenderness <br />
Lips that would kiss  <br />
Form prayers to broken stone.   </p>
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>The eyes are not here <br />
There are no eyes here<br />
In this valley of dying stars <br />
In this hollow valley <br />
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms  <br />
In this last of meeting places<br />
We grope together <br />
And avoid speech  <br />
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river <br />
Sightless, unless <br />
The eyes reappear <br />
As the perpetual star <br />
Multifoliate rose <br />
Of death's twilight kingdom <br />
The hope only <br />
Of empty men.</p>
<h4>V</h4>
<p><em>Here we go round the prickly pear</em> <br />
<em>Prickly pear prickly pear</em> <br />
<em>Here we go round the prickly pear</em> <br />
<em>At five o'clock in the morning.</em><br />
Between the idea  <br />
And the reality <br />
Between the motion<br />
And the act <br />
Falls the Shadow  <br />
<em>For Thine is the Kingdom</em><br />
Between the conception<br />
And the creation  <br />
Between the emotion <br />
And the response  <br />
Falls the Shadow  <br />
<em>Life is very long</em> <br />
Between the desire<br />
And the spasm <br />
Between the potency <br />
And the existence <br />
Between the essence <br />
And the descent <br />
Falls the Shadow  <br />
<em>For Thine is the Kingdom</em><br />
For Thine is  <br />
Life is <br />
For Thine is the  <br />
<em>This is the way the world ends</em>  <br />
<em>This is the way the world ends</em>  <br />
<em>This is the way the world ends</em><br />
<em>Not with a bang but a whimper.</em></p></div>
