        <div id="content">
            
                <div class="stanza">
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">There are several attitudes towards Christmas,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Some of which we may disregard:</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The social, the torpid, the patently commercial,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The rowdy (the pubs being open till midnight),</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the childish — which is not that of the child</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">For whom the candle is a star, and the gilded angel</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Spreading its wings at the summit of the tree</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Is not only a decoration, but an angel.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The child wonders at the Christmas Tree:</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Let him continue in the spirit of wonder</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">At the Feast as an event not accepted as a pretext;</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">So that the glittering rapture, the amazement</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Of the first-remembered Christmas Tree,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">So that the surprises, delight in new possessions</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">(Each one with its peculiar and exciting smell),</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The expectation of the goose or turkey</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the expected awe on its appearance,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">So that the reverence and the gaiety</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">May not be forgotten in later experience,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">In the bored habituation, the fatigue, the tedium,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The awareness of death, the consciousness of failure,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Or in the piety of the convert</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Which may be tainted with a self-conceit</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Displeasing to God and disrespectful to the children</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">(And here I remember also with gratitude</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">St. Lucy, her carol, and her crown of fire):</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">So that before the end, the eightieth Christmas</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">(By &#34;eightieth&#34; meaning whichever is the last)</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The accumulated memories of annual emotion</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">May be concentrated into a great joy</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Which shall be also a great fear, as on the occasion</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">When fear came upon every soul:</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Because the beginning shall remind us of the end</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the first coming of the second coming.</p>
