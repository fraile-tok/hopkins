        <h1>The Cultivation of Christmas Trees</h1>
        <p id="author">T.S. Eliot</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>There are several attitudes towards Christmas,<br />
Some of which we may disregard:<br />
The social, the torpid, the patently commercial,<br />
The rowdy (the pubs being open till midnight),<br />
And the childish â€” which is not that of the child<br />
For whom the candle is a star, and the gilded angel<br />
Spreading its wings at the summit of the tree<br />
Is not only a decoration, but an angel.<br />
The child wonders at the Christmas Tree:<br />
Let him continue in the spirit of wonder<br />
At the Feast as an event not accepted as a pretext;<br />
So that the glittering rapture, the amazement<br />
Of the first-remembered Christmas Tree,<br />
So that the surprises, delight in new possessions<br />
(Each one with its peculiar and exciting smell),<br />
The expectation of the goose or turkey<br />
And the expected awe on its appearance,<br />
So that the reverence and the gaiety<br />
May not be forgotten in later experience,<br />
In the bored habituation, the fatigue, the tedium,<br />
The awareness of death, the consciousness of failure,<br />
Or in the piety of the convert<br />
Which may be tainted with a self-conceit<br />
Displeasing to God and disrespectful to the children<br />
(And here I remember also with gratitude<br />
St. Lucy, her carol, and her crown of fire):<br />
So that before the end, the eightieth Christmas<br />
(By "eightieth" meaning whichever is the last)<br />
The accumulated memories of annual emotion<br />
May be concentrated into a great joy<br />
Which shall be also a great fear, as on the occasion<br />
When fear came upon every soul:<br />
Because the beginning shall remind us of the end<br />
And the first coming of the second coming.</p></div>
