        <div id="content"><p>I will serve in my daily life,<br />
The daily fight, the daily flight.<br />
In the days that run past my fingers,<br />
Those that He has gifted me.</p>
<p>I will hallow the little things,<br />
The little words, the little works.<br />
The things I hold in my hands,<br />
And those that flow from my mouth.</p>
<p>I will seek the hidden Love,<br />
He Ever-ancient, ever-new.<br />
Hiding in both chanting birds,<br />
And the foul, barking cars.</p>
<p>I will have my life mirror His,<br />
In Joseph's quiet workshop,<br />
In the houses of dear friends,<br />
And in the silence of my heart.</p>
<p>And I hope this, to Him,<br />
Leads many souls,<br />
And that my presence, leaves,<br />
With my steps, the <em>aroma Christi</em>.</p>
<p>I will: I will walk the <em>Way</em>.<br />
Through the <em>Furrow</em> and the <em>Forge</em>,<br />
From daybreak to its end.<br />
But do not count my steps:</p>
<p>Can you measure love? Quantify piety?<br />
Can you ask the burning heart,<br />
"How much do you love?",<br />
Without quenching its flame?</p></div>
