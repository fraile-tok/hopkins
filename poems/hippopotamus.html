        <h1>The Hippopotamus</h1>
        <p id="author">T.S. Eliot</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>The broad-backed hippopotamus<br />
rests on his belly in the mud;<br />
Although he seems so firm to us<br />
he is merely flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Flesh and blood is weak and frail,<br />
susceptible to nervous shock;<br />
While the True Church can never fail<br />
for it is based upon a rock.</p>
<p>The hippo’s feeble steps may err<br />
in compassing material ends,<br />
while the True Church need never stir<br />
to gather in its dividends.</p>
<p>The ‘potamus can never reach<br />
the mango on the mango-tree;<br />
But fruits of pomegranate and peach<br />
refresh the Church from over sea.</p>
<p>At mating time the hippo’s voice<br />
betrays inflexions hoarse and odd,<br />
but every week we hear rejoice<br />
the Church, at being one with God.</p>
<p>The hippopotamus’s day<br />
is passed in sleep; at night he hunts;<br />
God works in a mysterious way —<br />
the Church can sleep and feed at once.</p>
<p>I saw the ‘potamus take wing<br />
ascending from the damp savannas,<br />
and quiring angels round him sing<br />
the praise of God, in loud hosannas.</p>
<p>Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean<br />
and him shall heavenly arms enfold,<br />
among the saints he shall be seen<br />
performing on a harp of gold.</p>
<p>He shall be washed as white as snow,<br />
by all the martyr’d virgins kist,<br />
while the True Church remains below<br />
wrapt in the old miasmal mist.</p></div>
