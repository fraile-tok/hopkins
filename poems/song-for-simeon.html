        <h1>A Song for Simeon</h1>
        <p id="author">T.S. Eliot</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>Lord, the Roman hyacinths are blooming in bowls and<br />
The winter sun creeps by the snow hills;<br />
The stubborn season has made stand.<br />
My life is light, waiting for the death wind,<br />
Like a feather on the back of my hand.<br />
Dust in sunlight and memory in corners<br />
Wait for the wind that chills towards the dead land.</p>
<p>Grant us thy peace.<br />
I have walked many years in this city,<br />
Kept faith and fast, provided for the poor,<br />
Have taken and given honour and ease.<br />
There went never any rejected from my door.<br />
Who shall remember my house, where shall live my children’s children<br />
When the time of sorrow is come?<br />
They will take to the goat’s path, and the fox’s home,<br />
Fleeing from the foreign faces and the foreign swords.</p>
<p>Before the time of cords and scourges and lamentation<br />
Grant us thy peace.<br />
Before the stations of the mountain of desolation,<br />
Before the certain hour of maternal sorrow,<br />
Now at this birth season of decease,<br />
Let the Infant, the still unspeaking and unspoken Word,<br />
Grant Israel’s consolation<br />
To one who has eighty years and no to-morrow.</p>
<p>According to thy word,<br />
They shall praise Thee and suffer in every generation<br />
With glory and derision,<br />
Light upon light, mounting the saints’ stair.<br />
Not for me the martyrdom, the ecstasy of thought and prayer,<br />
Not for me the ultimate vision.<br />
Grant me thy peace.<br />
(And a sword shall pierce thy heart,<br />
Thine also).<br />
I am tired with my own life and the lives of those after me,<br />
I am dying in my own death and the deaths of those after me.<br />
Let thy servant depart,<br />
Having seen thy salvation.</p></div>
