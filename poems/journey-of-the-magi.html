                        <p class="verse-line">A cold coming we had of it,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Just the worst time of the year</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">For a journey, and such a long journey:</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The ways deep and the weather sharp,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The very dead of winter.&#39;</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the camels galled, sorefooted, refractory,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Lying down in the melting snow.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">There were times we regretted</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the silken girls bringing sherbet.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Then the camel men cursing and grumbling</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">and running away,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">and wanting their liquor and women,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the night-fires going out,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">and the lack of shelters,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And the villages dirty and charging high prices:</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">A hard time we had of it.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">At the end we preferred to travel all night,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Sleeping in snatches,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">With the voices singing in our ears, saying</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">That this was all folly.</p>
                    
                </div>
            
                <div class="stanza">
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">With a running stream and a water-mill</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">beating the darkness,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And three trees on the low sky,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And feet kicking the empty wine-skins.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">But there was no information, and so we continued</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And arriving at evening, not a moment too soon</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Finding the place; it was (you might say) satisfactory.</p>
                    
                </div>
            
                <div class="stanza">
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">All this was a long time ago, I remember,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">And I would do it again, but set down</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">This set down</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">This: were we led all that way for</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">We had evidence and no doubt.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">I had seen birth and death,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">But had thought they were different;</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">This Birth was</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">Hard and bitter agony for us,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">like Death, our death.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">With an alien people clutching their gods.</p>
                    
                        <p class="verse-line">I should be glad of another death.</p>
