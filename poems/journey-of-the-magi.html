        <h1>Journey of the Magi</h1>
        <p id="author">T.S. Eliot</p>
        <hr>
        <div id="content"><p>A cold coming we had of it,<br />
Just the worst time of the year<br />
For a journey, and such a long journey:<br />
The ways deep and the weather sharp,<br />
The very dead of winter.'<br />
And the camels galled, sorefooted, refractory,<br />
Lying down in the melting snow.<br />
There were times we regretted<br />
The summer palaces on slopes, the terraces,<br />
And the silken girls bringing sherbet.<br />
Then the camel men cursing and grumbling<br />
and running away,<br />
and wanting their liquor and women,<br />
And the night-fires going out,<br />
and the lack of shelters,<br />
And the cities hostile and the towns unfriendly<br />
And the villages dirty and charging high prices:<br />
A hard time we had of it.<br />
At the end we preferred to travel all night,<br />
Sleeping in snatches,<br />
With the voices singing in our ears, saying<br />
That this was all folly.</p>
<p>Then at dawn we came down to a temperate valley,<br />
Wet, below the snow line, smelling of vegetation;<br />
With a running stream and a water-mill<br />
beating the darkness,<br />
And three trees on the low sky,<br />
And an old white horse galloped away in the meadow.<br />
Then we came to a tavern with vine-leaves over the lintel,<br />
Six hands at an open door dicing for pieces of silver,<br />
And feet kicking the empty wine-skins.<br />
But there was no information, and so we continued<br />
And arriving at evening, not a moment too soon<br />
Finding the place; it was (you might say) satisfactory.</p>
<p>All this was a long time ago, I remember,<br />
And I would do it again, but set down<br />
This set down<br />
This: were we led all that way for<br />
Birth or Death? There was a Birth, certainly<br />
We had evidence and no doubt.<br />
I had seen birth and death,<br />
But had thought they were different;<br />
This Birth was<br />
Hard and bitter agony for us,<br />
like Death, our death.<br />
We returned to our places, these Kingdoms,<br />
But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,<br />
With an alien people clutching their gods.<br />
I should be glad of another death.</p></div>
